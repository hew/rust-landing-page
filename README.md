# Rust Landing Page Example

## What / Why

This is a landing page for a fictitious company. I built it to get some practice with Rust. Don't use this for anything. Not yet at least.

## Features 

- [x] Form Validation
- [x] POST request to Airtable API
- [ ] Design (open to pull requests)
- [ ] Preview (see: [#1](https://github.com/hew/rust-landing-page/issues/1))

## Notes

  * This was a blast to build.
  * I still have much to learn about Rust.

## Credits

  * Built from Martin's [quickstarter](https://github.com/MartinKavik/seed-quickstart-webpack)
  * Uses the [Seed framework](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed)
